## Modern Car Showcase application ReactJS, Next JS 13, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS

## Description

The demand for Next.js 13 applications peaked! So I thought it is perfect time now to build more projects in NextJS and become a much more professional NextJS/ReactJS developer. This Car Show Case app is a state-of-the-art modern application that leverages all of the latest and greatest of what Next 13 has to offer, leveraging features such as server-side rendering and the app router.

Alongside building this application, I've also used following technologies/techniques:

- Next.js 13 App Router and Server Side Rendering
- Implementing Advanced Search Functionality
- Creating Filtering Capabilities
- Optimizing Metadata and SEO
- Creating custom filter, combobox, and modal elements
- Maintaining a well-organized file and folder structure.
- Embracing the principles of writing clean code.
